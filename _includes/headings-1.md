You can't change font sizes in markdown, but you can create headings.

Begin a line with `#` to create a heading. The number of `#` corresponds to the heading level. You can specify up to 6 levels of headings.
<!--break--># Heading Level 1

## Heading Level 2

### Heading Level 3

This is a paragraph.

#### Heading Level 4

##### Heading Level 5

###### Heading Level 6

This is a paragraph.
