Strikethrough is not supported in Markdown (unless you're using it on [GitHub](http://guides.github.com/overviews/mastering-markdown/), which lets you use `~~text~~` syntax for strikethrough). However, Markdown supports HTML, so you can use `<del>` tags to strikethrough text.
<!--break-->
Use HTML to &lt;del&gt;strikethrough text&lt;/del&gt; in markdown.
